    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> 
        I supervised and guided the Hilo Bay Water Resources team during the summer 2024 NASA DEVELOP term. This phenomenal team worked in-pereson 
        in Hilo, Hawaiʻi to understand the feasibility of using satellite remote sensing to monitor water pollution. The team used Python, 
        Google Earth Engine, R, and ArcGIS Pro to acquire water quality data between 2013 to 2024. The satellites and sensors that they used included: 
        Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 9 OLI-2, Aqua and Terra MODIS, and Sentinel-2 MSI. For parameters, I suggested that the team use measures of 
        turbidity and chlorophyll-a, coupled with external data like weather events or sewage spills. At the end of their project, the team found that 
        remote sensing of water quality parameters within Hilo Bay is feasible, and that, depending on data availability, there is good alignment between 
        the occurrence of pollution events (brown water advisories) and turbidty and chlorophyll-a pixel presence. 
         </p>

    <p><strong>Results:</strong> Here are some examples of the team's results. For the full methodology and end products, please download their 
        project presentation and technical report (provided below).</p>
        
    <p>In this first image, we see a comparison between dates without a brown water advisory and dates with the advisory. The satellite data show 
        a corresponding turbidity response during dates with active brown water advisories.

    <p>The biomass data highlighted various areas that underwent carbon loss; however, it is important to note that I could only obtain biomass data 
      from 2023, rather than 2024. This mismatch in time periods for the study limits the interpretabilty of the results, but I forged ahead out of 
      curiosity.

    <p>The mapped tree cover and carbon loss showed that very select regions of the Fairbanks area had detectable carbon <i>and</i> tree cover loss. 
      Most of the study area depicted less than 5 Mg C lost between 2000 and 2023. </p>

    <p> <strong> Discussion and Conclusion:</strong> A more robust analysis of carbon loss, as well as additional data sources, would expand this project and produce stronger results. Fine-tuning 
      the data and investigating a larger study area would also perhaps improve the utility and relevancy of this work. The Global Forest Watch data 
      could be supplemented with optical data and vegetation indices (such as NDVI), while the process of calculating and obtaining carbon loss per 
      hectare could be built upon to incorporate alternative methods that rely on optical and SAR data. Ultimately, this was a quick project to strengthen 
      my remote sensing, coding, and GIS skills, so I hope to use what I've learned to produce more robust, reliable, and informative research projects.
