Hello and welcome to my portfolio! <br></br>

My portfolio is the one-stop-shop to get to know me and my work. As an avid learner, I am always trying to gain new skills, examine exciting environmental and 
Earth science questions, and build my capacity to support the natural systems and communities that surround us. My background experience includes GIS and remote sensing, field data sampling, education and community
engagement, and data analysis and visualization. If you are looking for a collaborator, new team member, or just want to chat, please reach out! I'd love to hear from you!<br></br>
